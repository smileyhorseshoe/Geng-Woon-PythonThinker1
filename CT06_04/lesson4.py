# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

# Red = $1
# Blue = $2
# Green = $3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->

#  Calculating red plates
#  1 red plate = $3
#  1 x $3 = $3
# redPlates = 3
# #  Calculating blue plates
# #  5 x $2 = $10
# bluePlates = 10
# # Calculating Green plates
# #  4 x $3 = $12
# greenPlates = 12
# Calculating total
# ans = greenPlates + bluePlates + redPlates

# Printing amount
# print("Your total is", ans, "dollars.")
