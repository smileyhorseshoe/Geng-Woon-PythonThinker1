# Lesson 4 - Strings

## Recap 1: Sushi Checkout

# You just had a lunch at a sushi restaurant and have to
# calculate the total amount you have spent. Different coloured
# plates costs different as shown below:

# Red = $1
# Blue = $2
# Green = $3

# You have ordered a total of 3 red plates, 5 blue plates, and 4
# green plates.

# Calculate and print the total amount you have spent: -->

#  Calculating red plates
#  1 red plate = $3
#  1 x $3 = $3
# redPlates = 3
# #  Calculating blue plates
# #  5 x $2 = $10
# bluePlates = 10
# # Calculating Green plates
# #  4 x $3 = $12
# greenPlates = 12
# Calculating total
# ans = greenPlates + bluePlates + redPlates

# Printing amount
# print("Your total is", ans, "dollars.")
# myName = input("What is your name?")
# print("Hello", myName, "welcome to coding!")

## Task 1: Storing and printing Strings

# **Task 1a**:
# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and
# store it in a variable. Then print that variable.

# **Task 1b**:
# Ask the user for their favorite colour using input() and
# store the response in a variable. Print the variable.

# **Task 1c**:
# Ask the user for their age using input() and store the answer
# in a variable. Print the variable.

#  TASK 1a
# myName = input("What is your name?")
# print("Hello", myName)

# # TASK 1b
# favColour = input("What is your favorite colour?")
# print(favColour)

# # TASK 1c
# age = input("What is your age?")
# print(age)

# print("Hello,",myName,"your favourite colour is",favColour,"and you are",age,"this year.")
