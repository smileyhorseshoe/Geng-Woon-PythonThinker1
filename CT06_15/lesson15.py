## Task 1: Self-introduction
# You are at a party, and you expect to see your friend Ethan and 3 of
# his friends you have never met before. They are Ben, Gracie, and
# Javior.

# Write a program (with or without functions) that will ask the user
# for their name and print 1 of 3 ways to greet the person:
# 1. If the person is Ethan, greet him by saying:
#         "Hi Ethan. How are you?"
# 2. If the person is either Ben, Gracie, or Javior, greet them by
#    saying:
#         "Hi there!"
#         "My name is Freddo"
#         "I like to swim and eat chicken wings!"
#         "Nice to meet you!"
# 3. If the person is none of the above, say:
#         "I don't think you belong here..."
