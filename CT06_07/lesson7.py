# Lesson 7 - For Loop (Part 2)

## Recap 1: Debugging Average Score Program

### There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
### Identify and fix the bugs:

score_one = 80
score_two = 90
score_three = 75

total = score_one + score_two + score_three
#  Changes made: "score_two + score+Three"
average_score = total / 3

student_name = "Alex"

print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + str(average_score))
# Changes made: Changed variable average_score to string from integer
