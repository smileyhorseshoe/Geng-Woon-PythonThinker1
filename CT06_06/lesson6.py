# Lesson 6 - Debugging

## Recap 1: Class Average Calculator

# You have been tasked to create a programme that calculates the
# average marks of a class.

# Your programme will have to ask the
# user for the total number of students, followed by the marks of
# each student one at a time.

# Use only variables, math operators that you have learnt, as
# well as a 'for' loop.
# StudentNum = int(input("How many people do you have in your class?"))
# Marks = 0
# for StudentNum in range(StudentNum):
#     Marks = Marks + int(input("What are their marks?"))
# print("My sum is:" + str(Marks))
# print("My average is " + str(Marks / StudentNum))

## Task 1: Syntax Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 1a**:
# for i in range(3):

# **Task 1b**:
# for i in range(5):
    # print(i)
#  Changes made:
# Indented line 31.
# **Task 1c**:
# print("Hello, World!")
#  Changes made:
# Added the closing inverted coma at the end of '!'
# **Task 1d**:
# If = 5

# print ("Hello, World!")
# Changes made:
#  Added the brackets

## Task 2: Name Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# # **Task 2a**:
# age = int(input("What is your age?"))
# print(age)

# # Added input to ask the user for their age.
# # **Task 2b**:
# name = "Alice"
# print(name)
# # Changes made:
# # Added a 'e' to line 7
# # **Task 2c**:
# x = 5
# print(x)
# # Changes made:
# # Reversed the order

# # **Task 2d**:
# print("Hello, World!")
# # Changes made:
# # added a 'r' to print

## Task 3: Type Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 3a**:
age = 25
print(age + 1)
# Changes made:
#  removed the inverted commas
# **Task 3b**:
number = 10
print(number - 5)
# Changes made:
# Removed the inverted comma line 81
# **Task 3c**:
print("Repeat" * 3)
# changes made:
# Removed inverted commas
# **Task 3d**:
year = 2023
print("The year is " + str(year))
# Changes made
# Changed the variable 'year' to a str 
# **Task 3e**:
x = 10
y = x / 2
# Changes made:
# Removed inverted commas during assignment of varible 'x'
# **Task 3f**:
end = 5
for i in range(end):
    print(i)
# Changes made:
# Removed inverted commas during assignment of varible 'end'
