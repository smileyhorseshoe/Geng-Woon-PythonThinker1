# have entered is positive or negative.

# 1. Ask the user to input a number
# 2. Using an 'if' statement, check if the number is greater than 0
#         If it is, print "{number} is positive."
# 3. Use an 'else' statement for when the number is not greater than 0.
#         In this case, print "{number} is negative."
# number = int(input("Give me a number(NO DECIMALS!)"))
# if number > 0:
#     print("Your number is a positive number.")
# else:
#     print("Your number is a negative number.")
