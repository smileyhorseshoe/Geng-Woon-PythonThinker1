# Lesson 8 - Importing Libraries, Boolean & Conditions

## Recap 1: Product of 5 numbers

# Write a program to calculate the product (multiplication) of 5
# numbers.

# 1. Using a for loop, ask the user for 5 numbers one at a time.
# 2. Calculate the multiplication for these 5 numbers and print
#    it out.
# num = 0
# for i in range(5):
#     num = num * int(input("What number is" + str(i + 1)))
# print(num)
## Task 1: 'time' library

# **Task 1a**:
# Import the 'time' library and make use of the 'time.sleep()'
# function to create a 10 seconds countdown timer that counts
# to 1, printing the number of seconds remaining every second.

# **Task 1b**:
# Modify your code from Task 1a to include an 'input()' function
# asking the user for the number to countdown from, before
# counting down every second from the number given by the user.
import time
for i in range(10 , 0 , -1):
    print(i)
    time.sleep(1)
print(" 1A Done")
# 1
