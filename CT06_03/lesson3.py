## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79
#  To find average - 4 ppl so sum up the score of everyone(4) and divide by 4(the number of the people)
# Save the scores into 4 variables .etc - Adam, Brandon, Charlie, Daniel into variables like num1 - num4
# Add the value of num1 - num4 and save it to a variable called "average"
# Divide the variable "average" by the number of persons(4)


# 3.Recap1
# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score
# 10. End
# age = 10
# print("age")
x = 10
x = 20

print(x)
# num1 = 5
# num2 = num1
# ans = num1 - num2
# print(ans)
# num1 = 3468765876479678457846785478548756486786786876
# num2 = 4541524210000000000000000000
# ans = num1 / num2
# print(ans)
