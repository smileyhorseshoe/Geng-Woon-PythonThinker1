## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79
#  To find average - 4 ppl so sum up the score of everyone(4) and divide by 4(the number of the people)
# Save the scores into 4 variables .etc - Adam, Brandon, Charlie, Daniel into variables like num1 - num4
# Add the value of num1 - num4 and save it to a variable called "average"
# Divide the variable "average" by the number of persons(4)


# 3.Recap1
# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score
# 10. End
# age = 10
# print("age")
# x = 10
# x = 20

# print(x)
# num1 = 5
# num2 = num1
# ans = num1 - num2
# print(ans)
# num1 = 3468765876479678457846785478548756486786786876
# num2 = 4541524210000000000000000000
# ans = num1 / num2
# print(ans)

## Task 2: Simple addition calculator
# **Task 2a**:
# Create 2 variables holding 2 different numbers:
# Print out the sum ("+") of the 2 numbers
# num1 = 564
# num2 = 468
# print(num1 + num1,"(addition)")
# print(num1 - num2,"(subtraction)")
# print(num1 / num2,"(division)")
# print(num1 * num2,"(multiplication)")
# print(2+4*5/6+3-6/2)

## Task 3: Mathematics with variables
# For each of the following questions, create variables to hold
# the values given before finally using print(ans) to print the
# answer:

# **Task 3a**:
# Create 2 variables 'a' and 'b', assign any number to
# them and print their sum.

# **Task 3b**:
# Subtract 10 from 50, then multiply the result by 3.

# **Task 3c**:
# Divide 100 by 4 and print the result.

# **Task 3d**:
# Calculate and print the result of (3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2).

# **Task 3e**:
# Calculate and print the result of 3 / 2.

# ACTIVITY
# Task 3a
a = 50
b = 50
print(a + b)
# Task 3b
print((50- 10)* 3)
# Task 3c
print(100 / 4)
# Task 3d
print((3+4) * 5 - (10/2))
# Task 3e
print(3 / 2)

## VARIABLES QUIZ
# Which of the following are INVALID variable names?

# 1. variable1
# 2. 1variable
# 3. 1
# 4. one
# 5. num1
# 6. num_1
# 7. Num_1
# 8. num 1
# 9. num-1
# 10. class

# Which of the following are INVALID variable assignments?
# 1.  a = 100

# 2.  b = 5
#     a = b

# 3.  100 = a

# 4.  a = b = c = 5

# 5.  a, b = 5, 6

# 6.  b = 5
#     a = b * 10

# 7.  b = 5
#     a = a * 10
