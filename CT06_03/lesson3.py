## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79
#  To find average - 4 ppl so sum up the score of everyone(4) and divide by 4(the number of the people)
# Save the scores into 4 variables .etc - Adam, Brandon, Charlie, Daniel into variables like num1 - num4
# Add the value of num1 - num4 and save it to a variable called "average"
# Divide the variable "average" by the number of persons(4).
num1 = 5
num2 = 20
num1 + num2 == ans
print(ans)
